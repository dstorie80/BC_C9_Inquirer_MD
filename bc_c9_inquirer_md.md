    ## Description
    
    This was created to get a better understanding of Inquirer 
    
    - To learn how to create markdown docs from the command line as well as other text docs
    - To get more practice on creating docs for coding and code explination using the command line and js
    - Not depending on GitHub to create readme docs
    - I learned that just about any question you can put in a markdown can be done through JS and Inquirer
